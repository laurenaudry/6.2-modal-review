## Development
  - `$ npm install -g webpack`
  - `$ npm install -g babel-cli`
  - `$ npm install -g webpack-dev-server`


## Words
  - CLI - Command Line Interface - Allows us to write commands in Terminal to execute functions (this is why we use `npm install -g`)
  - Spec - is another word for a file with tests...
  - Spec Helpers - reusable code (functions) for specs...
